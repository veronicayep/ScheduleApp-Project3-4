# ScheduleApp-Project3-4

## Project 3

After your successful work on its showcase site, the Mr.Coffee company would like to put your skills to the service of its internal organisation. They ask you to develop a schedule management website for its teams.

The company first asks you to create a small prototype, which it will present to its teams to assess whether such a website could be useful to them.

For this project, you will have to store data and display it in a browser. To do this, you will discover databases with MySQL and make a small web application.

The prototype will be very simple and will have only two pages: a page to create a schedule, and a page to display all existing schedules.

The M.Coffee company doesn't give you any visual constraints but asks you to make something visually clean and readable.

## Project 4

The Mr.Coffee company presented your prototype to its teams, who are enthusiastic and confirm the usefulness of a website for their schedules. The company therefore commissions you to go beyond the prototype and make a second version of the application, with user accounts and authentication.

You will again use Express and MySQL to build the application, but this time you will need to create an account and login system.

The site will be very simple with few pages. It will be "divided" into two types of pages: pages only accessible to registered users, and login/registration pages.

Employees ("users") will be able to create an account for themselves on the site. Once their account has been created, each employee will be able to log in to create their own schedules and consult all existing schedules.

The entry point to the site will be a login page. Beware, accessing other pages (directly via the url for example) must be strictly impossible for unregistered users. If a user tries to display a page without being connected, you must redirect him to the login page. 

When logged in, users will access a home page that displays all existing schedules. From there, the user can view the profile and schedules of a particular employee or add their own schedules.

Mr.Coffee does not give you any visual constraints but asks you to do something visually clean and readable. To help you, it sends you a site map to respect.
